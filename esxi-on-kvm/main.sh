## NOTE: you MUST run this as root
## errata: there are a couple places where it assumes the primary network interface is called eth0

# VARIABLES YOU MUST SET -- this whole thing will break if you dont set these
# You will need to download the ISOs for the VCSA appliance you want to use and point VCSAISO to it
# You will need to set the vsphere version.  It can only be 7.0 or 6.7.  Other values will break things.
# You must set the DNS parameters
# The AD user and password is needed to insert appropriate DNS records into your environment.  
# oddly enough, the way kinit works you have to capitalize the domain name in the ADUSER variable
#
DNSIPADDRESS1=
DNSIPADDRESS2=
VCSAISO=
VSPHEREVERSION=
DNSDOMAIN=
ADPASSWORD=
ADUSER=
HOSTPASSWORD=
SSOPASSWORD=

## These variables tune the size of the ESXi hosts that get deployed
## The default represents the practical minimum.  
## In aggregate, there are 10 ESXi hosts, 2 of which
## are management hosts.  Both management hosts house a VCSA of size "small", which is 24GB RAM in 8.0
##
## You want a little bit of overhead on those hosts, hence 28GB is a good minimum for those two.
## 16GB for each of the 8x Compute hosts is a good amount considering all of the sample and storage VMs
## that get deployed by the later parts of these scripts
##
## In total, the default will require the following physical resources on the server for the KVM domains
##
## Memory: 164GB
## VCPU: 40 
## 
## [Due to the way I've got various services running on L0 you should leave a decent amount of cpu cores and ram free]
##
## This means the default settings below will run on a c5n.metal host in AWS, which has 72 vcpu and 192GB RAM
## c5n.metal is the cheapest x86_64 baremetal instance type at $3.88/hour or $2838.24/month (on demand) 
##
## Personally, I recommend an m5zn.metal.  Only 24 real / 48 HT VCPU but they are 4.5GHz Xeon 8252's vs 3GHz 8124M's
## m5zn.metal is almost as cheap as c5n.metal at $3.96/hour or $2893.79/month (on demand)
##

MEM=12
CORE=4
MGMTMEM=24
MGMTCORE=4

## All that said, if you don't care as much about cost and need bigger/faster ESXi hosts, I would recommend
## an r6i.metal with 128 VCPU and 1024 GB memory.  They have even newer 3.5 GHz Intel Xeon 8375C (Ice Lake) cpus
## Cost goes up significantly, though.  r6i.metal costs $8.06/hour or $5886.72/month (on demand)
##
## With an r6i.metal, you could raise these parameters to something like the following:
##
## MEM=64
## CORE=8
## MGMTMEM=96
## MGMTCORE=12
##
## It might make more sense at that point to just raise the number of total nested hosts from 10 to 20 or something
## Unfortunately, as of Jan 2023, you will have to hack the scripts especially the python ones that configure the 
## vsphere clusters.  There are hard coded spots in there.  Maybe I will change this in time.

## this inserts the exports into configure_l0_env.sh which is sourced elsewhere
## long story short, it makes them permanent in case you need to just re-run subcomponents
## yes its a hack that was added later
